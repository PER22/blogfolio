# BlogFolio
## by Padraic Reilly

BlogFolio is an easy way to share your projects, and discuss how they evolve over time. Blog posts can be linked to an existing project, making it easy to follow its evolution over time. 

Blog posts and your projects' descriptions are both rendered using react-markdown, a way to safely perform text-to-HTML transformation while avoiding the danger of XSS. This allows the creation of  visually appealing articles that have a helpful internal structure. More information about react-markdown can be found here: https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown


Currently, BlogFolio is deployed to:
